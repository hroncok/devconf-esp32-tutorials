\begin{enumerate}

\item
    You will need a set-up environment and an \abbr{ESP32} board
    with a \abbr{PCF8574} chip and a 7-segment display.

\section{I/O expander and 7-segment displays}

    A 7-segment display has 7 (or 8) LEDs packaged in an “8” shape.
    \hfill
    \begin{tikzpicture}[overlay]
        \path[use as bounding box] (-\textwidth,0) (0,0);
        \node[left] {\includegraphics[width=1cm]{7seg}};
    \end{tikzpicture}

    Each LED can be connected to a Pin to turn it on or off, forming numbers.

    The \abbr{ESP32} has a lot of pins\footnote{The chip has 48 pins, though
    not all are exposed and some are reserved for specific uses.},
    but if you start connecting displays,
    you'll run out pretty fast.
    That's why we'll use an \emph{I/O expander} – a chip with many extra pins,
    and a few pins for you to tell it which ones to turn on (using a more
    complicated protocol than on/off).

    The \abbr{PCF8574} has 8 output pins and understands the “two-wire” I$^2$C
    protocol, for which MicroPython has a handy library.
    I$^2$C needs 2 pins on the controller (called {\scl} – \underline{s}erial
    \underline{cl}ock – and {\sda} – \underline{s}erial \underline{da}ta).
    Two to eight may not look like a big improvement, but those two pins can
    control many I$^2$C devices at once.

    The disadvantage? Communication is relatively slow.
    For example, you can't do PWM very well with a simple I/O expander.

\section{Driving a 7-Segment display}

\item
    The I$^2$C {\scl} and {\sda} pins are connected to \abbr{ESP32}'s
    pins \#22 and \#21, respectively.
    Create a `machine.I2C` object with this configuration:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    from machine import Pin, I2C
    i2c = I2C(scl=Pin(22, Pin.OUT), sda=Pin(21, Pin.OUT))
    \end{lstlisting}

    Next, scan for devices connected to this I$^2$C bus.
    You already know there is one, but a `scan` will also tell you its address:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    print(i2c.scan())
    \end{lstlisting}

    Send a one-byte message of 255 to it.
    This assumess you got address `35`; adjust if it's different:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    address = 35
    i2c.writeto(address, bytes([255]))
    \end{lstlisting}

    That should turn the digit fully on.

    \begin{comment}
        The display has two digits, but for simplicity, we've only connected
        one of them.
        There are enough wires as it is!
    \end{comment}

\item
    In binary, `255` is 11111111$_b$ – eight bits set to 1;
    eight pins with voltage; eight segments lit.

    Python allows you to write individual bits directly, as binary numbers,
    using the `0b` prefix:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    value = 0b11111111
    \end{lstlisting}

    Change some of `value`'s `1` bits to `0`s, and try forming a number!

\item
    Count up from 0 to 9 – or even from 0 to F.

\item
    When you're done experimenting with the display,
    let's find another use for the expander.
    Turn the page to see how to drive a stepper motor!

    You will need a set-up environment and an \abbr{ESP32} board
    with \abbr{PCF8574} and \abbr{ULN2803} chips and a battery connector.

\section{Some theory on stepper motors}

\item
    A \emph{stepper motor} is a device that rotates in discrete steps.

    Steppers allow precise continuous movement.
    They are used in printers, 3D printers and plotters, automated window
    blinds, car window wipers and so on.

    Steppers work by attracting the rotating center, the \emph{rotor}, to
    strategically placed electromagnets around it.

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \foreach \angle in {0, 90, 180, 270}{
        \foreach \n in {1, 2} {
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \node[rotate=-\angle] {
                    \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{stepper\n}
                };
            \end{tikzpicture}
        }
    }
    \caption{Turning a stepper motor. Active electromagnets are highlighted red.}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{comment}
        This is simplified for clarity.
        There are many variations and improvements on this basic principle.
    \end{comment}

    There are a few things to watch out for.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    To allow the motor to turn, you'll need to wait about $1 \si{\milli\second}$
    after setting the electromagnets.

    \item
    Eight steps per revolution isn't a lot, so the motor has some gears inside
    to make the axle turn more slowly.
    It takes 512 full turns of the rotor to turn the axle around once (360°).

    \item
    Each of the 4 magnets needs to be controlled by a Pin.
    That's a lot of pins (especially if you want more motors),
    so we'll use an IO expander.

    \item
    We can't drive a motor with I/O pins directly.
    Turning a motor involves large currents, which could damage the
    microcontroller.
    So, we use a specialized chip: the \abbr{ULN2803} \emph{Darlington array}.
    It has 8 binary logic (“pin”) inputs and 8 corresponding high-current
    outputs that use a dedicated power source (batteries).
    Software-wise, it works as if the motor was connected directly to
    the I/O expander.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Turn a stepper motor}

\item
    Write a program to drive the motor.
    Use pins 0-4 on the I/O expander for this, and visualize the output
    on the 7-segment display.

    You'll need to output the following bit patterns:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    0001
    0011
    0010
    0110
    0100
    1100
    1000
    1001
    \end{lstlisting}

    To make this visible, delay for $300 \si{\milli\second}$ after setting each
    pattern.

    Let the booth staff check the result and give you a stepper motor and
    batteries to play with.

\item
    Plug in the motor and reduce the delay to $100 \si{\milli\second}$.

    Turn the motor exactly $90 \si{\degree}$ – that is, cycle through the bit
    patterns $128$ times.

\item
    Turn $90 \si{\degree}$ in the opposite direction.

\item
    Look at the 3D printer at another booth to see how a stepper's precise
    turning is converted to linear motion.

\item
    Programming challenge!

    Make the motor turn continuously.
    Then, get a second motor from booth staff and make it turn at $\frac23$
    speed of the first one.

    How would this kind of behavior be useful in a 3D printer?

\item
     Please return the gadgets when you're done experimenting.
